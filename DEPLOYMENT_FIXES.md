# Deployment Issues Fixed

## Issues Found:

### 1. **Missing CSS File**
- The `index.html` was referencing `/index.css` which didn't exist
- This caused 404 errors when the application tried to load styles

### 2. **Incorrect Dependency Setup**
- Using external CDN imports via importmap instead of proper Vite bundling
- Missing React TypeScript types (`@types/react`, `@types/react-dom`)
- This prevented proper build optimization and type checking

### 3. **Build Configuration Issues**
- Vite config needed better production build settings
- Missing chunk splitting for better performance

## Solutions Applied:

### 1. **Created `index.css`**
- Added basic CSS reset and custom styles
- Removed Tailwind imports since we're using CDN version
- Added proper scrollbar styling for dark/light themes

### 2. **Updated `package.json`**
- Added missing React TypeScript types
- Ensured all dependencies are properly defined for Vite bundling

### 3. **Fixed `index.html`**
- Removed external importmap dependencies
- Simplified to use Vite's bundling system
- Kept Tailwind CDN for quick styling

### 4. **Enhanced `vite.config.ts`**
- Added proper build configuration
- Improved chunk splitting for vendor libraries
- Better production optimizations

### 5. **Updated `index.tsx`**
- Added CSS import to ensure styles are loaded
- Maintained proper React 19 setup

## Deployment Status:
✅ Build now works locally  
✅ GitHub Actions will automatically deploy on push  
✅ Application should be available at: https://subashkanthasamy.github.io/advanced-emi-calculator/

## Next Steps:
1. Wait for GitHub Actions to complete deployment (usually 2-3 minutes)
2. Check GitHub repository → Actions tab to monitor deployment progress
3. Verify the live application is working correctly

## Key GitHub Pages Settings:
- Repository: subashkanthasamy/advanced-emi-calculator
- Branch: gh-pages (auto-created by GitHub Actions)
- Source: Deploy from branch
- Folder: / (root)

The deployment should now work correctly!
